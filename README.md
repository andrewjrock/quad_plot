# quad_plot
## this script takes four different visuals and plots them on one graph (each in one quadrant, hence the name). 
## the visuals are assumed to each be named for the gauges they represent, and the visuals are already generated.
## the use of this script is in putting the visuals together for synthesis/analysis/interpretation.
